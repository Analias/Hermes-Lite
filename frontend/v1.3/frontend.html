<h2> Hermes-Lite Frontend Version 1.32 (February 2016) </h2>

<p>
The frontend board 1.32 is a direct replacement for previous boards.  It differs in that the output
is taken directly from the TxDAC, not the IAMP.  This results in a cleaner transmit signal.  The design
output level is 10 dBm, the level required for current Tx amp designs.  The board can also be used as an experimental
platform for other filters or for different output power levels.  See the Hermes-Lite Google group for current information.
</p>
<p>
The 1.32 board MUST USE SPECIAL FIRMWARE.  The firmware for the 1.2 boards will seem to work, but
will not produce the proper result.  The 1.3 firmware disconnects the IAMP so that it doesn't load the TxDAC.

The directory frontend/v3 contains all the KiCad and other files needed to build the board.  Some useful files are:

<h3> Build Option: T/R Switch </h3>
<p>
There is an RF switch on board that can be used as a transmit/receive (T/R) switch.  To use it,
mount the PE4259 switch and the P2 connector (antenna).  Omit P3.
</p>
<p>
Otherwise, omit the PE4259 and mount both P2 (RF output) and P3 (RF input).  Then jumper P5 to P8 and P6 to P7.
</p>
<h3> Build Option: Voltage Regulator </h3>
<p>
There is an adjustable voltage regulator on board.  It is an experimental feature that can be used to test
different op amps and supply voltages.  It provides 10.3 volts and is powered from the 12 volt rail.  The SN10501D op amp specified
in the BOM does not need the voltage regulator provided that the input voltage is 10 to 16 volts.  But if other op amps
with lower maximum supply voltages are used, it limits Vcc to safe levels.  If you omit it, connect pin 1 to pin 3.
To try different voltages, adjust R4 and R5.
</p>
<h3> Build Option: Output Resistor </h3>
<p>
You can reduce the output back termination resistor R16 to get up to 6 dB more power.  It is set to 50 ohms to produce a 50 ohm
output impedance.  But be aware that an op amp is a voltage source, and if the load impedance is zero you will exceed its maximum
power dissipation.  Also op amps can become unstable if they drive a capacitive load.  Look at the data sheet and proceed with care.
But if your load is an amp with a sensible input impedance, you should be alright.
</p>
<h3> Build Option: Other Op Amps and Output Powers </h3>
<p>
You can increase the feedback resistors R13 and R14 to get more gain and more output power.  But the SN10501D is a voltage feedback
op amp and you will decrease the bandwidth, perhaps below 30 MHz.  If that becomes a problem, you can substitute a current feedback
op amp.  But current feedback op amps require a specified feedback resistor for maximum bandwidth.  We don't want maximum bandwidth, so
it is better to use a larger value to decrease the bandwidth.  To get the required gain, you may need to change R11 and R12.  But that sets
the filter load impedance, so the filter may have to be redesigned.  This all requires some more work.
</p>
<p>
The Hermes-Lite runs from 3.3 volts.  There are op amps that work at this supply voltage.  Using one of these and decreasing the gain may
be of interest when the Hermes-Lite is used as an instrument.
