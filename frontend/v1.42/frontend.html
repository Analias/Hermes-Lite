<h2> Hermes-Lite Frontend Version 1.42 (April 2016) </h2>

<p>
The frontend board 1.42 is a direct replacement for previous 1.2 boards.  It differs in that the output
is taken directly from the TxDAC, not the IAMP.  It differs from the 1.32 board in that it uses a dual
op amp and has a higher output level.
The board can also be used as an experimental
platform for other filters or for different output power levels.  See the Hermes-Lite Google group for current information.
</p>
<p>
The frontend boards with versions greater than 1.3 MUST USE SPECIAL FIRMWARE.  The firmware for the 1.2 boards will seem to work, but
will not produce the proper result.  The newer firmware disconnects the IAMP so that it doesn't load the TxDAC.

The directory frontend/v4 contains all the KiCad and other files needed to build the board.  Some useful files are:

<h3> Build Option: Transformers </h3>
<p>
Transformer T1 is an 8:1 Z with the low impedance side towards the SMA.  You can use a commercial part
MABA-010143-FLUX18.  Or you can wind your own by following the directions for the 1.2 board.  Transformer T2
is a 1:1 wound on a BN-43-2402 core, four turns bifilar.  It can carry half a Watt and there is no good
commercial substitute.  It provides good performance from 1.8 to 29.7 MHz.  If you have only BN-61-2402 cores,
try to wind 11 turns, or as many as you can manage.  For lower frequencies like the new 630 meter band, you will
need a transformer designed for lower frequencies.
</p>
<h3> Build Option: T/R Switch </h3>
<p>
There is an RF switch on board that can be used as a transmit/receive (T/R) switch.  To use it,
mount the PE4259 switch and the P2 connector (antenna).  Omit P3.
</p>
<p>
Otherwise, omit the PE4259 and mount both P2 (RF output) and P3 (RF input).  Then jumper P5 to P8 and P6 to P7.
</p>
<h3> Build Option: Output Resistors </h3>
<p>
You can reduce the output back termination resistors R7 and R8 to get up to 6 dB more power.  They are set to 24 ohms to produce about a 50 ohm
output impedance.  But be aware that an op amp is a voltage source, and if the load impedance is zero you will exceed its maximum
power dissipation.  Also op amps can become unstable if they drive a capacitive load.  Try using 4.7 ohms each.  Look at the data sheet and proceed with care.
Do not omit these resistors because there is a small (5 mV) difference in DC level at the outputs, and you don't want a short through T2.
If your load is an amp with a sensible input impedance, you should be alright.  These resistors dissipate significant power.
They are specified as 1/4 Watt.  But the DigiKey part number given is for a 1/2 Watt resistor, and that is preferable. If you use a 1/8 Watt
resistor, try to stay with lower powers and check the temperature.
</p>
<h3> Build Option: Other Op Amps and Output Powers </h3>
<p>
You can try other op amps and gains.  But current feedback op amps require a specific feedback resistor R14 and R16 for maximum bandwidth.  We don't want maximum bandwidth, so
it is better to use a larger value to decrease the bandwidth.  To get the required gain, you will need to change R6.  The OPA2677 is an interesting substitute for
the OPA2674.  It has a pad to solder to the board for greater power dissipation, but is otherwise similar.  Both parts are specified to operate down to
5 volts in case you want to run from batteries.
</p>
<h3> Build Option: Filters </h3>
<p>
There may be alternative filter designs available on the Hermes-Lite Google group.
